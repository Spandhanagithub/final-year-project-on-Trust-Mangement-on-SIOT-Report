INTRODUCTION
The proliferation of interconnected devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape has revolutionized various aspects of modern life, ranging from smart homes to industrial automation. However, this interconnectedness also introduces significant challenges, particularly concerning the establishment of trust and security within IoT networks. Ensuring trust between entities in such networks is critical for facilitating reliable and secure communication, as well as for safeguarding against malicious activities and unauthorized access. The SIoT Trust project endeavors to address these challenges by leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms to assess and classify trust relationships within IoT environments. By analyzing a diverse range of parameters including temporal information, packet delivery metrics, device characteristics, and social network influences, the project aims to develop robust models capable of discerning trustworthy interactions from potentially untrustworthy ones.Key to the project's methodology is a multi- faceted approach that encompasses data preprocessing, clustering, and classification. Through meticulous preprocessing steps, the raw dataset is refined and prepared for subsequent analysis.
Clustering techniques such as K-means are then employed to segregate trust and untrust data, laying the groundwork for subsequent classification tasks. A suite of classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, is used in IoT networks to categorize trust relationships. With a thorough analysis using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, the project seeks to determine each algorithm's effectiveness in
accurately discerning trustworthiness. Furthermore, the project emphasizes the importance of interpretability and transparency in model development. While achieving high classification accuracy is crucial, it is equally essential to understand the underlying factors driving the model's decisions. Thus, the project places a significant emphasis on feature importance analysis and model interpretability, enabling stakeholders to gain insights into the trust dynamics within IoT networks. In the rapidly evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT), establishing trust between interconnected devices is becoming increasingly challenging. The lack of robust mechanisms to assess and classify trust relationships within IoT networks leaves them vulnerable to various security threats and compromises. Existing methods often fail to provide comprehensive solutions that address the dynamic nature of trust dynamics in IoT environments. The aim of the SIoT Trust project is to develop a machine learning-based framework for assessing and classifying trust relationships within IoT networks. By leveraging data-driven approaches, the project seeks to enhance the security and reliability of IoT ecosystems by accurately discerning trustworthy interactions from potentially untrustworthy ones. The proposed SIoT Trust system leverages machine learning algorithms and data-driven approaches to address the limitations of existing methods. By collecting and analyzing diverse parameters relevant to trust relationships, the proposed system aims to provide a more accurate and robust framework for assessing and classifying trust within IoT networks. Through rigorous evaluation and interpretability analysis, the proposed system seeks to enhance the security and reliability of IoT ecosystems, paving the way for safer and more resilient interconnected systems.

The methodology for implementing the proposed device trustworthiness prediction system adopts a structured and iterative approach, encompassing key phases from data preparation to model evaluation. Initially, the process begins with Data Collection and Exploration, wherein a comprehensive dataset containing relevant device attributes such as device type, brand, and model is acquired. This step is crucial for understanding the underlying structure of the data, identifying any missing values, outliers, or duplicates, and gaining insights into the distribution of features. Following data collection, the next phase is Data Preprocessing, where various techniques are employed to ensure data quality. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates appropriately. Additionally, categorical variables are converted into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding, while numerical features are scaled to bring them within a consistent range. Subsequently, Feature Selection is conducted to identify and select relevant features that significantly contribute to predicting device trustworthiness. Techniques such as correlation analysis and feature importance scores from machine learning models are utilized to determine the most influential attributes. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets in the Data Splitting phase, facilitating model training and evaluation. It's essential to ensure a representative distribution of classes in both sets to avoid bias during model training and evaluation. In the Model Selection phase, suitable machine learning algorithms are chosen for the prediction task, considering factors such as interpretability, accuracy, and scalability. A diverse ensemble of algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, may be implemented to explore different modelling approaches. Model Training involves training each selected model on the training dataset using appropriate hyperparameters. Cross-validation techniques are leveraged to ensure robust performance and avoid overfitting. Model Evaluation is conducted to assess the performance of each model on the testing dataset using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves are utilized for a detailed understanding of model behaviour and performance characteristics.
Hyperparameter Tuning is performed to fine-tune the hyperparameters of selected models, optimizing their performance. Techniques like grid search or randomized search are employed to explore the hyperparameter space effectively. Finally, Visualization is employed to generate visualizations such as feature importance plots and prediction result visualizations, aiding in model interpretation. Graphs and charts are utilized to present key findings and insights gleaned from the analysis, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the device trustworthiness prediction system.

The curve plots the true positive rate on the y-axis and the false positive rate on the x-axis. A perfect classifier would have an ROC curve that reaches the top-left corner of the plot, indicating high sensitivity and low false positive rate across all threshold values. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of the model's discriminative ability, with a value of 1.00 representing perfect classification performance. In this case, the AUC is 1.00, indicating that the SVM model achieves optimal discrimination between trustworthy and untrustworthy instances in SIoT environments.
 
Fig 4 : Confusion Matrix for Logistic Regression
The provided confusion matrix illustrates the performance of a Logistic Regression model in a trust management system for SIoT environments. This matrix is a tabular representation of the model's predictions compared to the actual values in the dataset. Each cell in the matrix corresponds to a specific classification outcome: True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), and True Positive (TP). In this case, the matrix indicates that out of the total instances evaluated, 4447 were correctly classified as negative (True Negatives), while 4116 were correctly classified as positive (True Positives). However, there were 256 instances incorrectly classified as positive (False Positives) and 180 instances incorrectly classified as negative (False Negatives). This matrix provides valuable insights into the performance and accuracy of the Logistic Regression model in distinguishing between trustworthy and untrustworthy interactions within SIoT environments
 
Fig 5: ROC Curve for Logistic Regression
The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve for the Logistic Regression model in the trust management system for SIoT environments demonstrates the trade-off between its True Positive Rate (sensitivity) and False Positive Rate (1 - specificity). The curve plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. A higher area under the ROC curve (AUC) indicates better model performance, with a perfect classifier yielding an AUC of 1. In this instance, the curve displays a smooth upward trend, indicating the model's ability to effectively discriminate between positive and negative instances.

Fig 8: Naive Bayes Model Performance Evaluation
The confusion matrix for Naive Bayes provides a comprehensive overview of the model's performance in classifying instances within the trust management system for SIoT environments. It delineates four key metrics: True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN). Among these metrics, the model correctly identifies 4283 instances as positive (trustworthy) and 4000 instances as negative (untrustworthy), reflecting its ability to effectively discern between the two classes. However, the model misclassifies 13 instances as positive when they are actually negative and 31 instances as negative when they are actually positive. While these misclassifications are minimal compared to the total instances, they still indicate areas where the model's performance could be improved.
Meanwhile, the ROC curve for Naive Bayes illustrates the trade-off between the true positive rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (1-specificity) across different classification thresholds. With an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 1.00, the ROC curve demonstrates exceptional performance, suggesting that the Naive Bayes model excels in distinguishing between positive and negative instances with high accuracy and reliability. This robust performance underscores the model's suitability for trust management in SIoT environments, where precise classification of trustworthy and untrustworthy relationships is paramount.
